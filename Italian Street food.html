    <p>It is no secret that Italy has America beat when it comes to homegrown cuisine. From creamy carbonara to melt-in-your-mouth burrata, Italian fare boasts some of the most drool-worthy dishes to ever grace our dinner tables (and our stomachs). Try as we might to mimic the mouthwatering meals stateside, any lucky duck who has visited Italy knows that nothing compares to tasting the real deal, straight from the source. Sigh.

        <p> Take everything you think you know about pizza, and then throw it out the window. This is your new pizza now. Pizza al taglio, or “pizza by the cut,” is baked in large rectangular trays and sold by weight on the streets of Rome (and just about everywhere else in Italy nowadays).
