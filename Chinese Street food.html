    <h2>JIANBING (CHINESE CREPES)</h2>
	
        
        <ol>

        <p>This is one Chinese most common street breakfast snack. I love its crispy nature, bold flavor and texture. It’s a made batter of wheat and grain flour, savory, umami flavors, eggs and other crisp textures. It’s a Northeast China Native dish.

It is prepared by thinly spreading the batter on the hotplate, placing the various toppings on the crunching batter and then another smaller sheet of crispy batter is placed on top</p>

     <h2>Fried Rice</h2>
	
        
        <ol>

        <p> This is one of the famous dishes in China. It includes the cracking of an egg in a wok then adding the rice followed by the spring onions. Go ahead and add a piece of meat, pork or chicken. Toss it and serve it hot. Although it can be found on your streets it is also a loved home snack.</p>
